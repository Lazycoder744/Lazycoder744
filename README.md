## Hi there!

I'm Ilan, a dumb idiot who uses a very **overpowered** i don't even know years old Lenovo Thinkpad T460 for all of his projects. Don't expect me to be sucessfull in the future. Please. Don't believe in me. That's not healthy.

Coding languages:

- Python (4 Years experience :/)
- Java (1 Year ;\ )
- Swift (1 Year practical)
- C# (2 days)
- I like ice cream

Skills:

``` - section .data
    msg db 'vrooom vrooom', 0  ; I'm really good at making comments in code, vroom

section .bss

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Writing funny comments in code, this line make program go vrooom vroom, asm is a pain
    mov rax, 1              ; When the system callllsssssss
    mov rdi, 1              ; The lines of the UNKNOWN (stdout)
    mov rsi, msg            ; Hey, what's the address?
    mov rdx, 13             ; How long is that again? I like to mov it mov it
    syscall                 ; Make the program go vrooom vrooom, Yes, yes.

    ; Exit the program
    mov rax, 60             ; Time to gooooo, 
    xor rdi, rdi            ; Exit code 0, mission failed, we will get them next time
    syscall
```
- Knows asm? WHO USES THAT?
- Sleep deprived
- on overdrive
- all the time
- help

You read this? Weirdo.
